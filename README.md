# types.bi
A configurable utility library for FreeBASIC.

It (for now) implements normalised aliases for all of FreeBASIC numeric types, as well as vectors (2, 3, and 4-dimensional) and arrays. I started writing it for myself, as a little tool to make my macros easier to write.

(I'll post a real manual at some point.)
